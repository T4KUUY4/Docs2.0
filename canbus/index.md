# Canbus

##  Introduction

These guides contains all the the steps needed, to install Canbus toolhead boards. 

Please read the guide carefully; there are many details that seem trivial but are included because one or more people got stuck at these points. We as a community want to make sure that everyone has the best experience possible. If you find something confusing and would like clarification, that likely means someone else in the past or future has found/will also find it difficult. Please reach out and we will gladly update the documentation!

This guide is designed to be a "universal" setup guide that can be used across all printers in the Voron lineup.

## What is CanBus and why you might like it?
To sum it up, CanBus reduces your overall MCU to Toolhead wiring from 12+ wires, down to just 4 wires.
It is mostly used in automotive Applications though. Chances are very high that your car uses it.
